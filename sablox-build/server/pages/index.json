This app is called **Oramatismós** because it is used to visualise classic sorting algorithmes.\n\n## Description\nThis is a progressive web app built with React. This app is used for visualizing different algorithms. The description of these algorithms is explained in the app. In addition to this, their time complexity in different cases (Best, Average & Worst) and space complexity is also given.\n## Developers\n\n - Saqib Rasheed\n - Kainat Fatima\n\n## Algorithms\nIt visualises following algorithms:\n\n 1. Bubble Sort\n 2. Selection Sort\n 3. Insertion Sort\n 4. Merge Sort\n 5. Quick Sort\n 6. Quick Sort 3\n 7. Heap Sort\n 8. Shell Sort\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis app is our ESP (End Semester Project) of the course CS250 - Data Structures & Algorithms. Purpose of this app is to learn and improve web development & DSA skills.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThe basic audience of our project are those students who are trying to learn different algorithms and their functioning.\n\n## Demo\nThis app is deployed using **netlify** (free). You can visit this app [**here**](https://oramatismos.netlify.app/).\n\nThese images show this app on different devices.\n#### Desktop\n![enter image description here](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MlL-xYSOm_4/X_8ys7SK9DI/AAAAAAAAAx0/ptp-fmFetQMdqPZZzIm5dUwjVAW5wLqlQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/oramatismos.netlify.app+%25280%2529.jpg)\n#### Tablet\n![enter image description here](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--CcmmPuAeK0/X_8ysx1ie7I/AAAAAAAAAx4/i_sEhHq6N_A--fiypvQa-pw80-nyFVp3wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/oramatismos.netlify.app+%25281%2529.jpg)\n#### Mobile\n![enter image description here](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w7N1uTSPVdA/X_8ys3opLOI/AAAAAAAAAxw/jaSWq5IFGRcX7OWapa7ZeX7m95x6viHbwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/oramatismos.netlify.app+%25282%2529.jpg)\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you want to use this app, clone this repository:\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/rasheedsaqib/Oramatismos.git\n$ cd oramatismos\n$ npm i\n```\n## App Structure\nThe `src` folder contains following 4 folders:\n\n - `algorithms` - This folder contains files for all the different algorithms. File of each algorithm contains its function. Files import helper functions like **swap** & **createRange** from `helper.js` file. Files import functions to track data like **newTrackingData**, **addToTrackingData** & **lastSorted** from `trackingData.js`.\n - `assets`  - This folder containers **.svg** files of different icons.\n - `components` - This folder contains state-less components of the app.\n - `container` - This folder contains stateful components.
